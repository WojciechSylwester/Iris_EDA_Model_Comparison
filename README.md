## ðŸŒº Iris EDA + Model Comparison
### Summary
The goal of this project is to classify the Iris species. To achieve this, I understand the data by exploratory data analysis and make insights about it. Baseline models unable me to analyse errors of the models. I handle with these errors by using feature engineering. To achieve better accuracy, I perform hyperparameter tuning. Finally, I check the score using learning curves and compare the models.
